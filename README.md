# What's in a Name
## Overview

Welcome to Gabrielle Salamanca's Math 448 Course Project! This was done in Spring 2022 under Professor Tao He's guidance. 

The dataset used was "Are Emily and Greg more Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal?". This was found on Vincent Arel-Bundock's Github projects under Rdatasets, which is sourced from *Introduction to Econometrics* by Stock and Watson, who sourced their data from the research paper *Are Emily and Greg more Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination* by Bertrand and Mullainathan. It's been through the hoops, that's for sure.
